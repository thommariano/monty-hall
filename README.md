<p>This code attempts to replicate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a>.</p>
<p>The problem was made famous after a reader wrote to <i>Parade</i> magazine to ask Marilyn vos Savant the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her answer was to always switch the door. This was met with strong criticism from some individuals even with PhD's.</p>
<p>However, her answer is correct and the code is fun way to simulate the game experience.</p>
